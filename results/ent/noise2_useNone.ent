Entropy = 7.999829 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 237.47, and randomly
would exceed this value 77.79 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4954 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.145548582 (error 0.13 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000611 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
