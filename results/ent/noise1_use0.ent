Entropy = 7.999820 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 250.05, and randomly
would exceed this value 57.57 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5314 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.139788559 (error 0.06 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000203 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
