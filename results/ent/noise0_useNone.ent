Entropy = 7.999814 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 257.65, and randomly
would exceed this value 44.17 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4346 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142692571 (error 0.04 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000913 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
