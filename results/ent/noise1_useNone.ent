Entropy = 7.999823 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 244.85, and randomly
would exceed this value 66.50 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4155 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.146484586 (error 0.16 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.001805 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
