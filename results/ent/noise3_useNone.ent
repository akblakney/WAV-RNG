Entropy = 7.999823 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 246.32, and randomly
would exceed this value 64.03 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5490 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142332569 (error 0.02 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000669 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
