Entropy = 7.999804 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 271.23, and randomly
would exceed this value 23.17 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4589 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142428570 (error 0.03 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000369 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
