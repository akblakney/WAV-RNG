Entropy = 7.999839 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 223.41, and randomly
would exceed this value 92.38 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.6310 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.139644559 (error 0.06 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000281 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
