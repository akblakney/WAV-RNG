Entropy = 7.999808 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 266.28, and randomly
would exceed this value 30.09 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.6363 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.146268585 (error 0.15 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000042 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
